              <p id="t2k1"><b id="bigText">Peter is a musician</b><br> He just signed a $150,000 contract with a management company and label, was getting the money on March 17th, and was leaving for his first national tour on April 2nd.</p>
          
              <p id="t2k2"><b id="bigText">Peter was planning on breaking up with Mary</b> Their relationship was turning sour. He was very adamant that he would be doing it that week; their 1 year anniversary was at the end of the month and he thought it would hurt her less to get it over with before then. I thought it was some stupid logic, but hey, sometimes you just need a deadline.</p>
            
              <p id="t2k3"><b id="bigText">Mary is a trained paramedic,</b> she has been actively working as one for <b id="medText">six years </b> She’s always been interested in money. I know when she heard about his contract, she was pushing to get married, she wanted a cut of that... <br><b id="medText">a big cut.</b></p>
