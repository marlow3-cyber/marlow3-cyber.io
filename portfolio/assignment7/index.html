              <p>March 19th was a Wednesday and the day my brother Peter was found dead in his apartment. He was found with three stab wounds in his chest and a kitchen knife making a fourth into his heart. His girlfriend Mary claims to have been in the other room when it happened. She was the one to report it to the police. The cops ruled it as a suicide as soon as they found out he was on a new anti-depressant, disregarding all of the obvious tells of foul play.</p>
              
              <header><h1>Here are some things to know:</h1></header>
              
              <ol>
                  <li><b>Peter is a musician and just signed a $150,000 contract</b> with a management company and label, was getting the money on March 17th, and was leaving for his first national tour on April 2nd. </li>
                  
                  <li><b>Mary was pushing to get married.</b> When she heard of the contract, she wanted a cut of that, a big cut.</li>
                  
                  <li><b>Peter was planning on breaking up with Mary</b>, their relationship was turning sour. He was very adamant that he would be doing it that week; their 1 year anniversary was at the end of the month and he thought it would hurt her less to get it over with before then. I thought it was some stupid logic, but hey, sometimes you just need a deadline.</li>
                  
                  <li><b>Mary is a trained paramedic </b>, she has been actively working as one for six years. She’s always been interested in money.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>Her “alibi” story: she claims to have been in the shower when she heard Peter scream and then ran out to see him with a knife sticking out of his chest, blood everywhere. She was “so shocked that all her training flew out the window” and she “couldn’t think of what to do” so she pulled the knife out of his chest.</p>
              
              <p>My brother did not stab himself in the heart four times. He could ever do such a thing. <b>Mary killed Peter</b>. He deserves justice.</p>
