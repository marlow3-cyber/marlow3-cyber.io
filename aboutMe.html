                <p class="text" id="bookrev">A doctor visits a wealthy socialite at around the same time he is murdered. The doctor's new next-door neighbor is a retired private detective (a recurring detective in Agatha Christie’s books), a Mr. Hercule Poirot. The man who died (you would be correct in assuming it is Roger Ackroyd) has a step-son who is MIA and a house full of employees who may have motive. This book also had an insane twist in the end. It doesn’t really count as spoiling if I don’t <i>actually</i> spoil it, right? Okay maybe I’ll tell you this, then… it was the butler</p>
                <p class="text" id="bookrev">&#9734; 7/10 (minus 2 for making me have to read this with my phone close by so I can lookup definitions for the old slang Christie uses and the references to things I can’t relate to because I’m from the 21st century. Minus another just because the ending got me mad again hahahahahahaha &#128544; &#128544;)</p>

                <p class="text" id="bookrev">A lonely, highly intelligent mathematician ropes himself into covering up a murder for the woman who lives next door (who he has a major crush on). The book begins with the crime being committed, and follows storylines of the woman, lonely mathematician, the detectives on the case, and a physicist’s attempt at solving the crime. After finishing this book, I think the title “Devotion of Suspect X” refers to the extent to which a crush can take you; peace and love, and murder! Amazing turn around in the end of the book, but leaves a few loose ends that left <i>me</i> wanting to read more. Kind of feels like it ends in the middle of a plot-line. I don’t want to spoil anything for those of u who haven’t read it, but like,,,, really compelling stuff. </p>
                <p class="text" id="bookrev"> &#9734; 8/10 (minus 1 for how it ends, minus another for the fact that I wish I was smart enough to understand all the math theory they mention throughout the read).</p>

                <p class="text" id="bookrev">Here's a short story I really enjoyed. In it, there’s a new guy in town. He’s a war vet who has just moved to New England to get some peace and quiet, but some townies are making life LOT more difficult for him. They trash his place, party right outside his property, and yell at him for kinda no reason. The newcomer/narrator isn’t helping the situation either, though… he shines these lights on them and makes countless complaints to the police, who essentially just tell him to get over it. Plain old unwelcoming people. On top of <i>all this</i>, our narrator is going to therapy and we watch his thoughts become more and more murderous. At one point, he’s outside a townie’s house with a freaking gun and like about to shoot the whole place up, families included. But he decides to take revenge in a new way….</p>
                
                <p class="text" id="bookrev"> &#9734; 9/10 (this was a great read, I am only taking one away because I feel like putting 10/10 will make it seem like I just freaking loooove murder, when obviously I don’t. I hate murderers, I mean I’m making a whole website about it …..)</p>
